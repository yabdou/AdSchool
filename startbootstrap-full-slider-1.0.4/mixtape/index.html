            <p><center>Music has been both an interest and an imprtant form of expression for me for a very long time. So it seems fitting that I should include it in some way as part of mmy application. In order to show why I should be part of the Adschool, I have made this online mixtape of songs that demonstrate the reasons! I have chosen only four of the songs to explain, but the full playlist is at the bottom of the page. But for now, click on the song titles to see what I've written!</center></p>

                    <p class="maintext">The first song that I have highlighted is <strong>"Tell Me" by the Wonder Girls</strong>. While the song may not be in English it still reflects  my communication skills and affinity for collaborating and working in teams! (I can't speak Korean though...)</p>

                    <p class="maintext">The second song I have chosen is <strong>"Lisztomania" by Phoenix</strong>. Back in the nineteenth century Lisztomania was a valid form of hysteria directed towards the composer Franz Liszt by his fans during his concerts. I am a massive music fan (hence why I possess this fact) but thankfully not quite enough to experience such a hysteric reaction to my favourite artists and bands. I want to use my interests and knowledge of popular culture to help cme up with exciting and creative solutions whilst being part of the Ad School!</p>

                    <p class="maintext">Next is <strong>Lou Reed's "Walk on the Wild Side"</strong>. Risk taking and creativity walk hand in hand, and I would be excited to delve into new areas, such as Media and Production, which are quite different from the degree in History which I am studying towards.</p>

                    <p class="maintext"><strong>"This Must Be the Place" by the Talking Heads</strong> is the final song that I have chosen. After considering several career options I'm glad to have decided upon advertisng. I really want to have a job where I use creativity and logic to devise stratgies and solutions. If I am chosen, I know that the AdSchool will confoirm my ambitions by giving me a real oppurtunity to put my talents and skills into practice, as well as signpost the more specicfic area of advertising that I may find myself in</p>
