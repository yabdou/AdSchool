            <p>In order to show why I should be part of the Adschool, I have made this online mixtape of songs that demonstrate the reasons!</p>

                <p class="maintext">The first song that I have highlighted is <strong>"Tell Me" by the Wonder Girls</strong>. While the song may not be in English it still reflects  my communication skills and affinity for collaborating and working in teams!</p>

                <p class="maintext">The second song I have chosen is <strong>"Lisztomania" by Phoenix</strong>. Back in the nineteenth century Lisztomania was a valid form of hysteria directed towards the composer Franz Liszt by his fans during his concerts. I am a massive music fan (hence why I possess this fact) but thankfully not quite enough to experience such a hysteric reaction to my favourite artists and bands. I want to use my interests and knowledge of popular culture to help cme up with exciting and creative solutions whilst being part of the Ad School!</p>

                <p class="maintext">Next is <strong>Lou Reed's "Walk on the Wild Side"</strong>. Risk taking and creativity walk hand in hand, and I would be excited to delve into new areas, such as Media and Production, which are quite different from the degree in History which I am studying towards.</p>

            <div class="talking">
                <p class="maintext"><strong>"This Must Be the Place" by the Talking Heads</strong> is the final song that I have chosen. After considering several career options I'm glad to have decided upon advertisng. I really want to have a job where I use creativity and logic to devise stratgies and solutions. If I am chosen, I know that the AdSchool will confoirm my ambitions by giving me a real oppurtunity to put my talents and skills into practice, as well as signpost the more specicfic area of advertising that I may find myself in</p>
